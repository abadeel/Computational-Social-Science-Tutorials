Many social science dataset contain data on events of interest that are marked as place names and students find it difficult to convert those names into geo\-coordinates \(longitudes and latitudes\)\.

This tutorial uses Python\'s **Geopy** library for geocoding\. It has functions that convert addresses or location names into geographic coordinates \(latitude and longitude\)\.
